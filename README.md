## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

#### ✅ Docker
Install from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

#### ✅ .NET SDK (for local debugging)

On macOS:

```bash
brew install dotnet@8
```

On Windows/Linux: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

Use Docker Compose to build and start all services:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Available Services

| Service           | URL                    | Description              |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Application       | http://localhost:8000  | Swagger UI and endpoints |
| Mongo Express GUI | http://localhost:8081  | Web view into MongoDB    |

---

## 📘 Swagger UI

Once running, the application exposes Swagger documentation and testing tools at:

**🔗 [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

You can:
- Explore the API
- Try requests interactively
- Authenticate via Bearer tokens (for protected endpoints)

---

## 🔍 Security Scanning

### 1️⃣ Gitleaks (Secret Detection)

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect -s /path -v
```

---

### 2️⃣ Snyk (Vulnerability Scanning)

Authenticate:

```bash
export SNYK_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

Run Snyk tests:

```bash
# Code + dependencies
docker run --rm -it \
  -e SNYK_TOKEN=$SNYK_TOKEN \
  -v $(PWD):/app snyk/snyk:dotnet \
  snyk code test --all-projects

docker run --rm -it \
  -e SNYK_TOKEN=$SNYK_TOKEN \
  -v $(PWD):/app snyk/snyk:dotnet \
  snyk test

# Container scan
docker build -t insecuremongoapp-app .
docker run --rm -it \
  -e SNYK_TOKEN=$SNYK_TOKEN \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  snyk/snyk:docker \
  snyk container test insecuremongoapp-app:latest
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Tests are also run in CI via GitHub Actions.
