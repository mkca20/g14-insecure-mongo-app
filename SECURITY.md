## Security Findings

All Snyk findings (Open Source / SCA, Code / SAST, and Container) are published to this
repository's **Security tab → Code scanning alerts**:

https://github.com/cybr-champions-summary/g14-insecure-mongo-app/security/code-scanning

The scans run automatically on every push to `main`, so the alerts always reflect the current
state of the code — when you fix and merge an issue, its alert is resolved on the next run.
